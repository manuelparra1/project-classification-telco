* "Lower Rated White" and "Rated" were each found to be drivers of "churn"
    * Though the amount of influence each has is likely to be weak
* "Rating Difference" was found to be a driver of "churn"
* "Time Control Group" was found to be a driver of "churn" 
    * Being in the standard time control or not seemed to have a particularly strong influence.
* "Opening Name" was found to be a driver of "churn" 
    * churn percentage ranged from 20-37%
    * encoding all of these features would result in more noise than signal to the model
    * It may be possible to create groups of similar openings in order to make a more reasonable number features

* "Game Rating" was not found to be a driver of churn

# Features I am moving to modeling With
* "Lower Rated White" (small difference in churn percentage, but relationship to churn is statistically significant)
* "Rated" (small difference in churn percentage, but relationship to churn is statistically significant)
* "Time Control standard" (moderate difference in churn percentage, and dependance is statistically significant)
* "Rating Difference" (Large difference in rating observed, and difference is significant)
